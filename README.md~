WSN Mesh network for Meter Reading
This is created using the Exsiting rest example provided for Contiki OS 
Link: https://github.com/malvira/contiki-2.x-devl/tree/master/examples/rest-example
Although the example has only one Server Client application example my application requires multiple CoAP servers
Those Servers will act as Meter nodes 
It wil work as a multihop network so that end user can collect data from Boader router
